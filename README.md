# Machine-Learning-Preprocessing-
Basic Machine Learning Preprocessing techniques using python

Data preprocessing is required for cleaning the data and making it suitable for a machine learning model, which also increases the accuracy and efficiency of a machine learning model. It involves the following steps:

- Importing datasets
- Finding missing data
- Encoding Categorical Data
- Splitting the dataset into a training and test set
- Feature scaling


Dataset:

Communities in the US. Data combines socio-economic data from the '90 Census, law enforcement data from the 1990 Law Enforcement Management and Admin Stats survey, and crime data from the 1995 FBI UCR and created Communities and Crime Unnormalized Data Set and made it available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
